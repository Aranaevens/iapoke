There are two projects in once around the Pokemon theme and how to be the
very best.

The first part is Epicatch. The program does the pathfinding necessary
to catch either a lot of pokemons or the rarest and best ones. It navigates
the character on a map with a maximum of instruction each run.
The map has different tiles, that can be accessed only in certain states
(Flash, Surf, Bike for instance), the program takes those in account and
optimize the run.

The second part is Epifight. The program reaches a server to battle against
other trainers. The only implemented battles are IA vs IA for now.
Epifight will parse .csv files in order to get all relevant informations
about types, attacks and the attributes of all pokemons. It makes it thus
adaptable to custom Pokemons.
The IA works with a minmax tree, it isn't optimised yet as it doesn't weight
much flat stats increase.
